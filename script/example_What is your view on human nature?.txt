Hobbes: Men’s nature is brutish—driven by fear and desire for power. In the state of nature, life is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." Without a sovereign’s absolute authority, chaos reigns.

Locke: I disagree. Men are guided by reason and equality, endowed with natural rights to life, liberty, and property. The state exists by consent to protect these rights, not to dominate.

Rousseau: Both err. Humans are essentially good, compassionate, and free. It is society—its inequality and corruption—that perverts this natural innocence.

Hobbes: Your optimism ignores men’s relentless passions that breed conflict. Without a Leviathan, disorder prevails.

Rousseau: Your Leviathan enslaves the free spirit, crushing our natural virtue under iron chains.

Locke: Gentlemen, reason must prevail. Society evolves from consent and reason; it must balance authority and liberty, protecting rights without tyranny or naïve trust. Only through this can we tame nature’s perils and nurture our true humanity.
